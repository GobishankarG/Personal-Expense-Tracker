A simple console-based Personal Expense Tracker built with Python. This project allows users to record their daily expenses, categorize them, view summaries, and track their spending patterns over time. It's designed for beginners to intermediate learners who want to practice core Python skills and create a foundational project that can be expanded with more features, such as database integration or a web interface. 

Features:
Add Expense: Input and store expenses with a description, amount, category, and date. 
View Expenses: List all recorded expenses in a readable format. 
Delete Expense: Remove an expense entry by selecting its number from the list. 
Summarize by Category: Display the total expenses grouped by category. 
Calculate Total Expenditure: Show the total amount spent across all entries. 
Data Persistence: Save expenses to a JSON file to retain data between sessions (optional enhancement).
